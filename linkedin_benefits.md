* Linkedin is a glorified resume site.
* As someone who cares about privacy and intentionally managing my tools and
  public information, why did I keep a LinkedIn Profile? Why do we all?
* Unless your profile is exceptional for some reason, it probably does more harm
  than good.
* You and I are just another candidate in a tall stack
* Everyone still has a LinkedIn account out of **fear**.
    - Fear of scarcity. Not having a job when you need one
    - Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)
    - Fear of being different
* A site like LinkedIn wraps you up into a tiny, uniform package, sets you in an
  enourmous data warehouse next to millions of other tiny people just like you,
  and sells the lot of you.
* I'm still not sure if I just disappeared form my connections' LinkedIn or
  what. But one thing I am sure about: no one will notice.

* "Scrolling is dangerous."
    - Most of these systems seem to target dopamine-releasing pleasure mech in
      the brain, but some are built around darker psych patters (success
      relative to others, feeling of adequacy, social confirmation).
    - Most complaints bout LI is about the "news feed," apparently.
* "I deleted my [FB, LI etc] account and this is why" is a genre in itself.
    - They rarely say anything new
    - Social media is a waste of time, news feed is enraging, people put on a
      fake perfect persona
    - FOMO, insecurity, inauthentic connection, drama, controversy.
    - It's all true, but we have read it a countless number fo times

* Some people get jobs out of LI, some don't. Treat it as a live CV, not as
  social media. You might be obligated to have it, but don't waste too much of
  your time.
