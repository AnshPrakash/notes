## Just start

* Reasons to not start:
    - init info not conducive to understanding it
    - vague defn
    - waste time fumbling through starting without clear idea
* Reasons to just start:
    - might need to _seek clarification_
    - work until vague becomes unvague so then you can _put it off_
    - might need to _delegate_

## Contiguous Time Blocks

* Complex tasks require uninterrupted concentration.
* In case you need to reorganize, _put it off_
* But be sure not to take it to extreme, there might be time sensitive jobs
  waiting.

## Single-Task Important Items

* Single tasking an important item gives you the concentration you need to
  produce quality output.
* The only difference from the previous section seems to be that contiguous time
  blocks are necessary not only for this but also for those which will have a
  kick-back when interrupted.

## Put it Off

* Reasons to put it off:
    - fatigue
    - too large
* Put it off only when:
    - flexible deadline
* Helpful when:
    - sleep on a tough problem
    - regain energy (sleep)
    - know what to do

## Seek clarification

* Reasons to not seek clarification:
    - Don't want to be a bother
    - Interacting is a pain
    - Don't want to look incompetent
    (esp if the task giver thinks you should be able to complete it)
* So always try to do  things on your own.
* Only if you think more information is required, or the time to go from vague
  to unvague exceeds the expected amt, seek clarification

## Batch the simple stuff

* Maybe similar
* Batching may reduce the amount of total time required.
* Can help you get that shallow (sorry) sense of accomplishment.

## Task jar

* I don't know what this is.

## Strike when you are hot

* Do important things when you are at your best...
* Something like morning/night person
* It could help you if you knew when that time is so that you can schedule
  important tasks then.

## Feedback loop

* Uncertainty in the duration the task will take because it depends on things
  you haven't done yet.
* Something like _just start_ or _seek clarification_
* The more you do a task, the better you know about the task (or worse)
* Keep track and keey updating your goals on a feedback loop.

## Prioritize

* Do you even need to write this.
* Deadlines, need best order of tasks.
* May not be able to complete all tasks, so need to drop a few.
* But what if you prioritize incorrectly.

## Delegate

* Why not to delegate:
    - People may resent you for dumping your work on them.
    - You risk them not completing the task in time or adequately.
    - Need to spend time on explaining the task to them
* Why to:
    - Others may be able to perform the task equal or better than you.
    - You might have to drop other tasks if not

## Drop unimportant tasks

* Why not to:
    - How do you know it's unimportant
    - A seemingly unimportant task may be a test to see if you can handle more
      important tasks
* So always try to do everything before you drop due to exhaustion.

## Good enough

* Does everything need to be perfect? Yes, yes it does. But should you need to
  trade between completing all tasks and completing some but perfectly, which
  would you choose?
