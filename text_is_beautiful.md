* Books vs movies:
    - Uses words to convey the inner thoughts of a character in a way that a
      movie just can't.
    - Books increase your vocabulary.
    - Slow enough form of communication that you have plenty of time to think
      about the message the author is trying to transmit.
* Text is the most information dense medium on the Internet.
* "Data expands to fill the space available." Somewhat similar to "Task expands
  to consume all the free time available" or something.
* Average users should be willing to go on an eye-candy diet (because texts)
* Talks about how text has the potential to free us from the Internet
  information gatekeepers. Not about how text is more efficient in conveying
  information or something.
