* Do the real thing and stop doing fake alternatives
    - If you want to improve your French, working at a French job is more useful
      than listening to podcasts at home preparing for the job.
    - If you want to get better at writing music, writing songs is more useful
      than complex analysis of past hits and figuring out what made them great
    - Business owners who spend more time printing cards than finding clients.
    - Students who create elaborate multicolored folders for their clcasses
      instead of sitting down and studying.
    - Buying fancy workout gear instead of exercising to get in shape.
* Why then, if the way forward is so straight, do we insist on taking detours?
    - Real Thing is Hard
    - Real Things have risk
    - They have the possibility of failure.
    - They have the frustration.
    - They force you to confront the possibility that maybe you just aren't good
      enough.
* Rules for doing the real thing
    - Nothing is often better than something
        + Something is better than nothing, only if it's a real something
        + Fake somethings not only fail to create progress, they numb you to the
          possibility of real striving.
        + Fail to make meaningful progress on any of your goals, but still feel
          exhausted at the end of the day.
        + Doing nothing, in contrast, is restorative. It fosters the urge to do
          something.
    - The hard way is the easy way
        + Take the real thing as your starting point, the deviations you must
          take to overcome obstacles tend to be minor.
    - If you are not sure what the real thing is, just ask.
        + Those who have been there to know what the real pat is.
        + Tell them your plann and ask them if they think it's direct enough.
        + With so many forums on the web, saying you don't know anyone who has
          done it before is no longer an excuse.

* Watch someone very skilled do the real thing
    - Want to be better at chess? Play a lot of games but also watch top games
    - Want to be better at programming? ... but also read high quality code
      written by others.
    - Although it's not enough to watch, but also imitate
* "Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn."
* There is no such thing as universal advice. All advice is useful in some
  context, but no advice is useful in all contexts.
* Taking the first step often requires a lot fo research and thinking.
