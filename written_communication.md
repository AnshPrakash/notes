* Async communication is tool best suited for remote work.
* Setting up multiple zoom meetings every day will fail with remote work in the
  long run.
* Chats and video calls are problematic:
    - It's harder to initiate: not unlike sitting next to your teammate
    - It's too easy to initiate: now like when you are from different dept.
    - Everybody expects an immediate response. It's a chat.
    - It promotes secrecy. People are naturally shy, and prefer not to show
      "weakness" to other teammates. So they will keep their questions and
      updates mostly in private chats or private rooms.
    - Video meetings only one person can talk at a time.
    - No side-talks, can't whisper something to a sub-section group of people.
    - Video meetings feel more like a lecture. A true discussion is harder to
      facilitate
    - Video calls are tiring. The cam is focused on your face and everyone sees
      you all the time. You can't lose focus or wander away to give your mind
      some rest.
* Sync communication is problematic
    - When everyone is expected to be available at any point, the cost of
      interrupting someone and getting an immediate answer is lower than looking
      for an answer yourself.
    - Planning is another culprit. People will plan as they go, because they
      know they will never get stuck, people will answer their questions on
      time.
    - This creates a culture of interruptions in the organization.
    - Work time flexibility will be broken too. You need others to answer your
      questions so you need to sync up.
* Async writing can solve this
    - Unlike chat, lives longer, targets more potential audience and is easy to
      discover
    - Async writing don't assume a specific person context nor assume "current"
      events knowledge. Surprisingly, that doesn't necessarily make the text
      longer or harder to write.
    - Async records so that any person can easily search and look up these
      things
    - One place knowledge via writing, instead of private knowledge in private
      calls or chat rooms that is lost soon after.

* It's a good habit to say "This is what I understand about your proposal" and
  proceed to summarize and give the original speak an opportunity to correct
  you.
* Make the default response (or no response) in your benefit. "I'll make the
  change on Thursday. Please let me know if there are any concerns." instead of
  "Does everyone approve?" and "Ok, when should I do it? Thursday"
* there are reader types, and there are listener types. If you are dealing with
  a partner you better know which type they are.
* It doesn‘t make sense to hand a listener type a manuscript without talking
  about the subject, and it doesn‘t make sense to set up meetings with a reader
  type before you hand off the written argument.
