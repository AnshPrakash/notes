## An absurd reasoning

### Absurdity

* I have never seen anyone die for ontological argument. Galileo, who held a
  scientific truth of great importance, adjured it with the greatest ease as
  soon as it endangered his life. That truth was not worth the stake
* There are many causes for a suicide. Rarely is suicide committed through
  reflection.
* Killing yourself amounts to confessing. Confessing that life is too much for
  you or that you do not understand it. Confessing that "life is not worth the
  trouble."
* Living, naturally, is never easy. YOu continue making the gestures commanded
  by existence for many reasons, the first of which is habit. Dying voluntarily
  implies you have recognized the ridiculous character of that habit, the
  absence of any profound reason for living, and the uselessness of suffereing.
* This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly
  the feeling of absurdity. But is suicide a solution to the absurd?
* The body's judgement is as good as the mind's, and the body shrinks from
  annihilation. We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of
  thinking.
* Does the Absurd dictate the Death?
* It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be logical to ther
  bitter end. Men who die by their own hand consequently follow to its
  conclusion their emotional inclination. Is there a logic to the point of death
