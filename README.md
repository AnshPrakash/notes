# notes
This repository shall contain markdowns and text files; mainly summaries and
notes for interesting articles, blogs and other internet stuff.

## Why?
* Active Reading:
    - Making notes makes you think about what you are reading.
    - Ease in identifying the main ideas and supporting material (for your notes)
* Easier to review/reread:
    - Light weight
    - Organized and time saving
    - Without useless information
* Limited brain space:
    - There's simply too much on the internet; can't consume everything. But we
      can't just ignore all the nice stuff so let's make note and access if need
      be.
