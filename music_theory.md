## Music Theory

### Terminologies

* Score: visual representation of a piece of music or song
* Pitch: audible musical sound  (~frequency)
* Notes: representation of pitch [note:pitch::letter:sound]
* Staff: 5 parallel lines
* Note heads: black or white oval shapes on staff to indicate which notes to play

* Steps: 2 adjacent notes
* Leaps: !steps
* Ledger lines: staff's extra lines for individual notes too high or low

* Unison: same note, same key, same pitch
* Octave: same note, diff key, diff pitch (x2 the frequency)
* Whole step: adjacent white keys with black key in between
* Half step : adjacent white keys with no black key in between

* Semitone: half step; shortest distance between 2 adjacent tones
* Accidentals: black key borrow name from preceding white key;
* #(sharp): semitone above; b(flat): semitone below
* Enharmonic equivalents:  C# = Db, E = Fb and E# = F

* Clef: points of reference
* Treble clef: (G clef, Sol clef) G above middle C is the second line;
* Bass clef: (F clef, Fa clef) F below middle C is the fourth line;
* C clef: middle C is the center of the clef (alto - 3 and tenor - 4)
* C is the first ledger line in both these clefs
* Grand staff: 2 staffs; for multi tasking instruments (piano, harp)

* Rhythm: how sounds are distributed over time
* Quarter note: most common rhythmic unit; 0.3-1s; black note head with stem
* Half note: 2x quarter note; white note head with stem
* Whole note: 2x half note; white note head without the stem

* Eight note: half the duration of the quarter note; black note with flag
* Beam: Connect flags of eight note
* Sixteenth note: half the duration of the eight note; black note with 2 flags

* Beat: steady and systematic pulse
* Meter: systematic arrangement of beat patterns
* Quadruple meter (common): groups of 4 beats; 4/4
* Measure/Bar: groups of beats
* Beat heirarchy: strength of beats in a measure
  (strong(downbeat),weak,medium,weakest(upbeat))
* 4/4: 4 beats/measure, beat = quarter note (large c)
* Time signature: graphic symbol that indicates meter
* Tempo: speed of beats, measured in beats per minute
