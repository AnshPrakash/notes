* When someone tries to do something good and we don't think it's the right
  thing we punish them.
* When someone tries to do something and fails, we laugh at them.
* This means that if you want to avoid punishment the only way is to not try
  until you are certain that you are doing the right thing and will succeed at
  it.
* But the fastest way to learn something is to try something.
* When you say you are good at something, that's arrogant.
* When you say you are bad  at something, people will tell you that you're not,
  or treat it as a weakness.
* Self-knowledge of your own abilities is also essential for getting good at it.
* If, despite all this, you succeed, we put you on a pedestal and worship you,
  and then soon you inevitably turn out to be a flawed human being like everyone
  else, we tear you down and destroy you.
* Recap, you will be punished:
    - for trying new things.
    - for trying things that don't work.
    - for trying to understand how good you are at something.
    - for succeeding.

* Very short and to the point to the point that I think I rewrote the entire
  post in an attempt to summarize.
* Creating anything new ends up being really hard in part because while you
  struggle, everyone is shouting "lame!" from the sidelines (and doing nothing).
* "Even I could have done that!" "But you didn't."
* "It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat." - Teddy Roosevelt

* Building real self-esteem made it possible for me to start seeing that when I
  don't know something that doesn't decrease my value as a person.
* I don't think we are supposed to be bad at things:
    - There is no mechanism provided for becoming good at the things we're
      expected to be good at.
    - Most people aren't good at the things we're expected to be good at.
* Why are you announcing your good deeds to the whole world? A lot of religions
  and cultures condemn things like that.
    - Most religions are built upon stories of other people's good deeds. It
      seem hardly fair to disallow people from airing their own :) 
        + Most religions are built on third-party narratives of other people's
          good deeds; it's absolutely self-consistent for them to have negative
          view of first-party narrative of the same topic.
